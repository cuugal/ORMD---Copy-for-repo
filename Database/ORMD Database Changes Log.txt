Due to errors caused by no valid Faculty ID assigned to the "Test" account [i.e. no valid numFacultyId [table name: tblFaculty] assigned to this supervisor, a test faculty was inserted into the strFacultyName field in tblFaculty.

Following the Faculty restructure effective 1 July 2008, these changes were made:

FASS changes
i) "Faculty of Engineering" renamed to become "Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology".
ii) "Faculty of Information Technology" deleted, as no records exist.

FEIT changes
iii) "Faculty of Education" renamed to become "Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences".  Also changed all references in tblQORA to numFacultyId = 5 (i.e. HSS) to become 3 (FASS) as these are NOT autonumber / autoupdated fields.
iv) All Supervisors within the "Humanities and Social Sciences" faculty (Dimitri Mazin and Michelle Murch) were moved over to the "Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences" entry.
v) "Institute for International Studies" deleted, as no records exist.
