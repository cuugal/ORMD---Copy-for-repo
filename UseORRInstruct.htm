<H1 class="instruct">Online Risk Register</H1>

<p class="instruct">The Online Risk Register is an online database that allows managers of facilities, operations or projects to manage health and safety risk assessments. Any user can search all risk assessments without logging in. Facility managers can create and edit their own risk assessments.</p>

<p class="instruct">Risk Assessments and Safe Work Method Statements can both be entered into this risk register. The system is ideal for tasks specific to a facility such as a laboratory or workshop, however it can be used for any UTS facility. For chemical risk assessments, you can use <a href="http://www.ocid.uts.edu.au">OCID</a> to document and store risk assessments. OCID contains specialist requirements for chemical risk assessments.


<H2 id="All" class="instruct">All Users</H2>

<p class="instruct">There is no need to log in to simply view UTS risk assessments or SWMSs.<P>

<p class="instruct">Search results show risk assessments sorted by 'Faculty/Unit' then by 'Location'</P>
<p class="instruct">Selecting '<B>Preview</B>' displays page in a printable format.</P>


<H2 id="Supervisors" class="instruct">Supervisors</H2>

<p class="instruct">If you login as a supervisor to perform a search, you can edit your risk assessments. You will see the name of the hazardous task underlined as a web-link. Clicking on this link then takes you to an 'edit risk assessment' screen which allows you to change the risk assessment or delete it.</P>

<p class="instruct">You can select Print Preview before printing a signed hardcopy for your records.</P>
